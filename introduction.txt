Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Phemelo Tlapu. I am currently studying software engineering and learning Git and GitHub. I enjoy building projects, solving problems, and improving my skills every day.

I am excited to learn more about version control and become confident with tools like Git, GitHub, and Linux as part of my ALX course.
